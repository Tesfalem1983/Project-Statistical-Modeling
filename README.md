# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
    Project Description: Statistical modeling using python
    Project Goals: Access APIs’, get data, ,EDA, and build model.

## Process
    ### Step 1: Make API queries to Citybike.
    ### Step 2: Make API queries to both Foursquare & Yelp based on the bike station locations in Citybike.
    ### Step 3: Combine data, visualize to do EDA, and create SQLite database.
    ### Step 4: Build model to get r/ship between number of bikes & characteristics of the PoIs’ in that location.


## Results
    ### Comparison of foursquare and Yelp APIs’ show us that foursquare data give complete picture as compared to yelp data. Yelp data returned a very limited data of very few PoI locations. This it is recommendable to drop the data collected from Yelp for further analysis.    

## Challenges 
    ### Yelp API access limitations
    ### Stuck in some challenges that wasted lot of time in navigating to come out of it.


## Future Goals
    ### Finish building regression model to demonstrate relationship
    ### Perform further EDA to gain more insights on the combined data.
    ### Think of a way to change the regression model in to classification one.
